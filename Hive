1-What is the definition of Hive? What is the present version of Hive?
-Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in HDFS. The present version of Hive is Hive 3.1.2.
 
2- Is Hive suitable to be used for OLTP systems? Why?
-No, Hive is not suitable for OLTP systems. It is designed for batch processing and analytical workloads rather than real-time transactional operations. Hive queries have higher latency, making it more suitable for OLAP use cases.

3-How is Hive different from RDBMS? Does Hive support ACID transactions?
-Hive is different from RDBMS in several ways. Hive follows a schema-on-read approach, whereas RDBMS follows a schema-on-write approach. Hive does not natively support ACID transactions due to its focus on batch processing and historical data analysis.

4-Explain the Hive architecture and the different components of a Hive architecture?
-Hive architecture consists of three main components: Hive Metastore, Hive Query Processor, and Hive Execution Engine. The Metastore stores metadata about tables and partitions. The Query Processor translates SQL-like queries into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of MapReduce or other execution tasks. The Execution Engine executes the tasks on the underlying data processing framework.

5-Mention what Hive query processor does? And mention what are the components of a Hive query processor?
-The Hive query processor is responsible for parsing, analyzing, optimizing, and executing HiveQL queries. It includes components like Parser, Semantic Analyzer, Query Optimizer, and Query Executor.

6-What are the three different modes in which we can operate Hive?
-Hive can be operated in three different modes: Local mode, MapReduce mode, and Spark mode.

7-What are the features and limitations of Hive?
-Features of Hive include support for SQL-like querying language (HiveQL), scalability for large datasets, data warehouse infrastructure, extensibility through user-defined functions (UDFs), and compatibility with various data formats. Limitations include higher query latency, lack of real-time processing, and limited support for transactional operations.

8-How to create a database in Hive?
-To create a database in Hive, use the 'CREATE DATABASE' command followed by the database name.
For example, CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;.

9-How to create a table in Hive?
-To create a table in Hive, use the 'CREATE TABLE' command followed by the table name, column definitions, and optional table properties. 
For example:
CREATE TABLE mytable (
  column1 INT,
  column2 STRING
);

10- What do you mean by DESCRIBE, DESCRIBE EXTENDED, and DESCRIBE FORMATTED with respect to database and table?
-'DESCRIBE' is used to display the columns and their data types of a table or a database.
 'DESCRIBE EXTENDED' provides additional information about the table or database, including column comments and table properties.
 'DESCRIBE FORMATTED' provides detailed information about the table or database, including file format, storage location, and input/output formats.

11-How to skip header rows from a table in Hive?
-Hive does not have a built-in feature to skip header rows. However, you can use the 'ROW FORMAT' clause with the 'SERDE' property to specify a custom SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) that can handle skipping header rows during data loading.

12- What is a Hive operator? What are the different types of Hive operators?
-Hive operators are used to perform operations on data within Hive queries. Some of the different types of Hive operators are:
Projection: Selects specific columns from a table.
Filtering: Filters rows based on certain conditions.
Aggregation: Performs aggregations like sum, count, etc. on groups of data.
Join: Combines data from multiple tables based on a common key.
Sorting: Sorts the result based on one or more columns.
Union: Combines the result of multiple queries into a single result.

13-Explain about the Hive Built-In Functions.
  -Hive provides a wide range of built-in functions for data manipulation and analysis. These functions include mathematical functions, string functions, date functions, conditional functions, and more. They can be used in Hive queries to perform various operations on the data.

14-Write Hive DDL and DML commands.
-DDL (Data Definition Language) commands:
CREATE DATABASE: Creates a database.
CREATE TABLE: Creates a table.
ALTER TABLE: Modifies an existing table.
DROP DATABASE: Drops a database.
DROP TABLE: Drops a table.
DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands:
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
INSERT INTO: Inserts data into a table.
UPDATE: Updates existing data in a table.
DELETE FROM: Deletes data from a table.

15-Explain SORT BY, ORDER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY, and CLUSTER BY in Hive.
-SORT BY and ORDER BY are used for sorting the result of a query. SORT BY sorts the data within each reducer, while ORDER BY sorts the entire result set.
DISTRIBUTE BY is used for dividing the data across different reducers based on a specified column.
CLUSTER BY is similar to DISTRIBUTE BY, but it also sorts the data within each reducer based on the specified column.

16-Difference between "Internal Table" and "External Table" and when to choose "Internal Table" and "External Table" in Hive?
-Internal Table: Data and metadata of internal tables are managed by Hive. Dropping an internal table also deletes the data associated with it.
External Table: Data resides outside the control of Hive and can be shared between multiple systems. Dropping an external table only removes the metadata, not the data.
Choose internal tables when Hive should have full control over the data and when data is not shared with other systems. Choose external tables when data needs to be accessed by other systems or when data needs to persist even if the table is dropped.

17-Where does the data of a Hive table get stored?
-For internal tables, the data of a Hive table is stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) controlled by Hive. For external tables, the data can be stored in various locations such as HDFS, local file system, or remote storage systems.

18-Is it possible to change the default location of a managed table?
-No, it is not possible to change the default location of a managed table. The default location is determined by the configuration of the Hive metastore.
What is a metastore in Hive? What is the default database provided by Apache Hive for the metastore?

19-The metastore in Hive is a central repository that stores metadata about tables, partitions, columns, and other Hive objects. It manages the schemas and locations of the data.
- The default database provided by Apache Hive for the metastore is called "default".

20-Why does Hive not store metadata information in HDFS?
-Hive does not store metadata information in HDFS because HDFS is designed for storing large data files, while metadata is smaller in size and frequently accessed. Storing metadata in a separate storage system (Hive metastore) allows for more efficient querying and management of the metadata.


21-What is a partition in Hive? Why do we perform partitioning in Hive?
-A partition in Hive is a way to divide a table into smaller, more manageable parts based on the values of one or more columns. Each partition represents a subset of data with common characteristics.
Partitioning in Hive improves query performance by allowing the system to efficiently filter and access only the relevant partitions during query execution. It can also provide better data organization and simplify data management.

22-What is the difference between dynamic partitioning and static partitioning?
-Dynamic partitioning in Hive automatically determines the partition values based on the data being loaded or inserted into a table. It dynamically creates partitions as needed.
Static partitioning in Hive requires explicit specification of the partition values during data loading or insertion. Partition directories must be created manually before loading data.

23-How do you check if a particular partition exists in Hive?
-You can check if a particular partition exists in Hive by using the SHOW PARTITIONS command followed by the table name and a partition filter condition. If the partition exists, it will be listed in the output.

24-How can you stop a partition from being queried in Hive?
-To stop a partition from being queried in Hive, you can use the 'ALTER TABLE' command with the 'ENABLE/DISABLE OFFLINE' clause. By disabling a partition, Hive excludes it from query processing, and it won't be accessible until it is enabled again.

25-Why do we need buckets? How does Hive distribute the rows into buckets?
-Buckets in Hive are a way to further divide data within partitions for efficient querying. They provide a way to horizontally partition data based on a hash function applied to a specified column.
Hive distributes rows into buckets using a hash function on the specified column value. The hash function determines which bucket a particular row belongs to, allowing for faster data retrieval based on the bucket ID.

26-In Hive, how can you enable buckets?
To enable buckets in Hive, you need to specify the number of buckets and the column to be used for bucketing when creating a table. This can be done using the 'CLUSTERED BY' and 'SORTED BY' clauses in the 'CREATE TABLE' statement.

27-How does bucketing help in the faster execution of queries?
-Bucketing helps in faster execution of queries in Hive by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. Since rows with the same bucket ID are stored together, Hive can skip reading unnecessary data and perform more efficient data pruning during query execution.

28-How to optimize Hive performance?
-Some ways to optimize Hive performance include:
Partitioning and bucketing tables appropriately.
Using appropriate file formats like ORC or Parquet.
Enabling vectorization and predicate pushdown.
Tuning Hive configuration parameters.
Optimizing query design by reducing unnecessary joins or aggregations.
Caching frequently accessed tables.
Utilizing indexes and statistics.

29-What is the use of HCatalog?
-HCatalog is a table and metadata management tool in Hive that provides a unified view of data stored in various formats and storage systems, such as HDFS, HBase, and others. It simplifies data sharing and interoperability between different tools and frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem.

30-Explain the different types of joins in Hive.
-In Hive, the different types of joins include:
Inner Join: Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
Left/Right/Full Outer Join: Returns the matching rows along with non-matching rows from one or both tables.
Left/Right Semi Join: Returns only the matching rows from the left/right table.
Left/Right Anti Join: Returns only the non-matching rows from the left/right table.

31-Is it possible to create a Cartesian join between 2 tables using Hive?
-Yes, it is possible to create a Cartesian join between two tables using Hive by not specifying any join condition. However, a Cartesian join can result in a large number of rows and can be computationally expensive, so it should be used with caution.

32-Explain the SMB Join in Hive.
-SMB (Sort-Merge-Bucketed) join in Hive is a join optimization technique that leverages the fact that both tables are bucketed on the join columns. It performs a merge join by matching rows with the same bucket ID, resulting in more efficient and faster join operations.

33-What is the difference between ORDER BY and SORT BY in Hive?
-In Hive, both 'ORDER BY' and 'SORT BY' are used for sorting the data. However, there is a difference:
'ORDER BY' guarantees total order sorting of the data across all the reducers, but it can be slower as it requires a global sorting operation.
'SORT BY' performs a local sort within each reducer and does not guarantee a total order across all the data, but it can be faster as it allows parallel sorting within each reducer.
 
 34-What is the usefulness of the DISTRIBUTE BY clause in Hive?
-The 'DISTRIBUTE BY' clause in Hive is used to control the data distribution across reducers during query execution. It ensures that rows with the same distribution key are sent to the same reducer, enabling efficient data processing and better query performance.

35-How does data transfer happen from HDFS to Hive?
-Data transfer from HDFS to Hive occurs through the process of data loading. Hive provides various ways to load data from HDFS, such as using the 'LOAD DATA' command, inserting data into tables, or using external tables that reference the data location in HDFS. Hive interacts with HDFS to access and process the data during query execution.

36-Wherever I run the Hive query, it creates a new metastore_db. Why?
-The 'metastore_db' is a directory used by Hive to store the metadata information, including table schemas, partition information, and other metadata. By default, it is created in the current working directory where Hive is run. If you run Hive queries from different directories, each directory will have its own 'metastore_db' to maintain separate metadata instances.

37-What will happen if you have not issued the command SET hive.enforce.bucketing=true; before bucketing a table in Hive?
-If you haven't issued the command 'SET hive.enforce.bucketing=true'; before bucketing a table in Hive, the bucketing feature will not be enforced. Hive will allow you to create the table with bucketing specified, but it will not perform any bucketing operations during data loading or query execution.

38-Can a table be renamed in Hive?
-Yes, a table can be renamed in Hive using the 'ALTER TABLE' command with the 'RENAME TO' clause. This allows you to change the name of an existing table without altering its structure or data.

39-Write a query to insert a new column (new_col INT) into a Hive table at a position before an existing column (x_col).
-AlTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMNS (new_col INT) BEFORE x_col;

40-What is serde operation in Hive?
SerDe stands for Serializer/Deserializer in Hive. It is responsible for serializing the data when storing it in a table and deserializing it during query execution. SerDe allows Hive to work with different data formats and structures, enabling seamless integration with external systems.

41-Explain how Hive deserializes and serializes the data.
When querying data in Hive, the SerDe deserializes the raw data, which is stored in a specific format (e.g., text, JSON, Avro), into a structured format that can be processed by Hive. During data loading, the SerDe serializes the structured data back into the raw format for storage. This deserialization and serialization process allows Hive to work with various data formats.

42-Write the name of the built-in SerDe in Hive.
The built-in SerDe in Hive is called LazySimpleSerDe. It is the default SerDe used for handling simple text-based data formats.

43-What is the need for a custom SerDe in Hive?
-Custom SerDes are used in Hive when working with data formats that are not supported by the built-in SerDes. Custom SerDes allow Hive to process data in proprietary formats or complex structures that require specialized serialization and deserialization logic.

44-Can you write the name of a complex data type (collection data types) in Hive?
-Yes, Hive supports complex data types, such as arrays, maps, and structs. The names of these complex data types in Hive are:
Array: 'array<element_type>'
Map: 'map<key_type, value_type>'
Struct: 'struct<field1:data_type, field2:data_type, ...>'

45-Can Hive queries be executed from script files? How?
-Yes, Hive queries can be executed from script files. Hive supports the execution of queries stored in script files with a .'hql' extension. These script files can be executed using the 'hive' command-line interface by passing the script file as an argument: 'hive -f script_file.hql'.

46-What are the default record and field delimiters used for Hive text files?
-The default record delimiter for Hive text files is the newline character ('\n'), and the default field delimiter is the tab character ('\t'). However, these delimiters can be customized using the 'ROW FORMAT DELIMITED' clause in Hive table definitions.

47-How do you list all databases in Hive whose name starts with "s"?
SHOW DATABASES LIKE 's*';

48-What is the difference between the LIKE and RLIKE operators in Hive?
-The 'LIKE' operator in Hive performs a simple pattern matching using wildcard characters ('%' for any sequence of characters, '_' for any single character).
The 'RLIKE' operator, also known as regex-like operator, allows pattern matching using regular expressions for more complex and flexible matching criteria.

49-How to change the column data type in Hive?
-To change the column data type in Hive, you can use the 'ALTER TABLE' command with the 'CHANGE' clause to modify the column definition. Here's an example:
ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name new_column_name new_data_type;

50-How will you convert the string '51.2' to a float value in a particular column?
-To convert the string '51.2' to a float value in a particular column, you can use the 'CAST' function in Hive. Here's an example:
SELECT CAST('51.2' AS FLOAT) AS float_value;

51-What will be the result when you cast 'abc' (string) as INT?
-When you cast the string 'abc' as an INT, the result will be 'NULL' because the string cannot be converted to an integer.

52-What does the following query do?
-INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE employees
PARTITION (country, state)
SELECT ..., se.cnty, se.st
FROM staged_employees se;
The query inserts data from the 'staged_employees' table into the 'employees' table, overwriting any existing data. It partitions the data based on the 'country' and 'state' columns and selects specific columns (represented by '...') along with the 'cntry' and 'st' columns from the 'staged_employees' table.

53-Write a query where you can overwrite data in a new table from the existing table.
-INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE new_table
SELECT * FROM existing_table;
This query overwrites the data in the 'new_table' with the data from the 'existing_table'.

54-What is the maximum size of a string data type supported by Hive? Explain how Hive supports binary formats.
-In Hive, the maximum size of a string data type is limited to 2^31-1 bytes (2 GB). Hive supports binary formats by using the BINARY data type. The 'BINARY' type allows storing binary data, such as serialized objects or compressed data, in a column. It provides flexibility to handle various data formats efficiently.

55-What file formats and applications does Hive support?
-Hive supports various file formats, including text file format, SequenceFile format, ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) format, Parquet format, and Avro format. These formats enable efficient storage and processing of data in Hive. Additionally, Hive integrates with external applications and tools such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Tez for enhanced data processing capabilities.

56-How do ORC format tables help Hive enhance its performance?
-ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) format tables in Hive help enhance performance by providing advanced columnar storage techniques. ORC format compresses and indexes data, enabling faster read operations, efficient predicate pushdown, and reduced I/O. It also supports predicate filtering and column pruning, resulting in improved query performance.

57-How can Hive avoid MapReduce while processing a query?
-Hive can avoid MapReduce while processing a query by leveraging alternative execution engines like Apache Tez or Apache Spark. These engines provide faster and more efficient query processing by utilizing in-memory processing, dynamic task scheduling, and optimized data pipelines, reducing the dependency on the MapReduce framework.

58-What are views and indexing in Hive?
-In Hive, views are virtual tables that provide a logical representation of the data stored in underlying tables. Views allow users to query and analyze specific subsets of data without directly accessing the underlying tables.
Indexing in Hive refers to the creation of indexes on columns of a table. Indexes improve query performance by enabling faster data retrieval based on the indexed column(s). Hive supports different types of indexes, such as bitmap indexes and compact indexes.

59-Can the name of a view be the same as the name of a Hive table?
Yes, the name of a view can be the same as the name of a Hive table. However, it is generally recommended to use distinct and meaningful names for views and tables to avoid confusion and maintain clarity in the database schema.

60-What types of costs are associated with creating indexes on Hive tables?
The creation of indexes on Hive tables incurs both storage overhead and maintenance overhead.
Storage overhead: Indexes require additional storage space to store the index data structures, which can increase the overall storage requirements for the table.
Maintenance overhead: When data is inserted, updated, or deleted in the table, the corresponding changes need to be applied to the indexes as well, incurring additional maintenance overhead.

61-Give the command to see the indexes on a table.
-To see the indexes on a table in Hive, you can use the 'SHOW INDEXES ON table_name' command. Replace 'table_name' with the name of the table you want to check.

62-Explain the process to access subdirectories recursively in Hive queries.
-In Hive, you can access subdirectories recursively by using the recursive keyword in the LOCATION clause when creating an external table. This allows Hive to scan all subdirectories under the specified location and access the data stored within them.

63-If you run a 'SELECT *' query in Hive, why doesn't it run MapReduce?
-When you run a 'SELECT *' query in Hive, it retrieves all the columns and rows from the table. If the table is stored in a file format supported by Hive, such as ORC or Parquet, Hive can utilize the optimized file format's metadata and columnar storage to directly read the required data without the need for MapReduce processing.

64-What are the uses of Hive 'Explode'?
-The Explode function in Hive is used to transform an array or a map column into multiple rows, where each element of the array or key-value pair of the map is expanded into a separate row. It is commonly used for unnesting and flattening complex data structures to perform further analysis or processing.

65-What is the available mechanism for connecting applications when we run Hive as a server?
-When running Hive as a server, the available mechanism for connecting applications is the Hive Thrift Server. The Thrift Server provides a service that allows clients to connect and execute Hive queries over various programming languages using the Thrift protocol, such as Java, Python, and others.

66-Can the default location of a managed table be changed in Hive?
-No, the default location of a managed table in Hive cannot be changed. Managed tables are stored in a location managed by Hive itself, typically in the Hive warehouse directory specified in the Hive configuration.

67-What is the Hive ObjectInspector function?
-The Hive ObjectInspector is a component in Hive that is responsible for reading and interpreting the internal representation of data. It provides a standardized interface to access and manipulate data stored in various formats, such as text, binary, and complex data types, within Hive.

68-What is UDF in Hive?
UDF stands for User-Defined Function in Hive. It allows users to define custom functions that can be used in Hive queries. UDFs extend the functionality of Hive by enabling the execution of custom logic and transformations on the data during query processing.

69-Write a query to extract data from HDFS to Hive.
-To extract data from HDFS to Hive, you can use the 'LOAD DATA INPATH' command. Here's an example:
LOAD DATA INPATH '/path/to/input/file' INTO TABLE hive_table;
Replace /path/to/input/file with the HDFS path to the input file, and hive_table with the name of the target Hive table.

70-What is 'TextInputFormat' and 'SequenceFileInputFormat' in Hive?
-TextInputFormat and SequenceFileInputFormat are input formats in Hive used to read data from different file formats.
TextInputFormat is the default input format and is used to read text-based files where each line represents a record.
SequenceFileInputFormat is used to read data stored in the Hadoop SequenceFile format, which is a binary file format optimized for storing large amounts of key-value pairs.

71-How can you prevent a large job from running for a long time in Hive?
-To prevent a large job from running for a long time in Hive, you can enable query optimization techniques such as partitioning, bucketing, and indexing to improve query performance. Additionally, you can tune Hive configuration parameters related to query execution, such as 'hive.auto.convert.join' and 'hive.vectorized.execution.enabled', to optimize query processing.

72-When do we use 'explode' in Hive?
-We use the explode function in Hive when we have a column that contains an array or a map, and we want to unnest or flatten it. The explode function generates a new row for each element of the array or each key-value pair of the map, allowing us to process the data at the individual element level.

73-Can Hive process any type of data formats? Why? Explain in detail.
-Hive is capable of processing various data formats, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. This flexibility is achieved through the use of SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) libraries. SerDes allow Hive to interpret and transform data between its internal representation and different data formats, enabling compatibility with formats such as CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, and more. By supporting multiple data formats, Hive can work with diverse data sources and accommodate different data processing requirements.

74-Whenever we run a Hive query, a new 'metastore_db' is created. Why?
-The metastore_db directory is the default location where the Hive metastore database is stored. The metastore database contains metadata information about tables, partitions, schemas, and other structural details of the data stored in Hive. Whenever a Hive query is run, the metastore is accessed to retrieve metadata information and optimize query execution. The creation of a new metastore_db is not expected behavior, and it may indicate misconfiguration or an issue with the Hive setup.

75-Can we change the data type of a column in a Hive table? Write a complete query.
-No, it is not possible to directly change the data type of a column in a Hive table. Instead, you need to create a new table with the desired schema and then insert the data from the original table into the new table. Here's an example query:
-- Create a new table with the desired data type for the column
CREATE TABLE new_table (
    column1_new_type INT,
    column2 STRING,
    ...
);

-- Insert data from the original table into the new table
INSERT INTO TABLE new_table SELECT CAST(column1 AS INT), column2, ... FROM original_table;

-- Optionally, you can drop the original table and rename the new table
DROP TABLE original_table;
ALTER TABLE new_table RENAME TO original_table;

76-While loading data into a Hive table using the 'LOAD DATA' clause, how do you specify it is an HDFS file and not a local file?
-When loading data into a Hive table using the 'LOAD DATA' clause, you specify that it is an HDFS file by providing the HDFS file path as the source of the data. The HDFS file path typically starts with 'hdfs://' or is relative to the HDFS root directory. Here's an example:

LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs://<HDFS_PATH_TO_FILE>' INTO TABLE hive_table;

Replace <HDFS_PATH_TO_FILE> with the actual HDFS file path where the data is located.

77-What is the precedence order in Hive configuration?

-Hive configuration has a precedence order to determine the values of configuration properties. The precedence order is as follows:
Hive session-specific properties (SET command)
Hive database-specific properties (ALTER DATABASE command)
Hive table-specific properties (ALTER TABLE command)
Hive user-specific properties (set in hive-site.xml or custom configuration files)
Hive system properties (set in hive-site.xml or custom configuration files)

78-Which interface is used for accessing the Hive metastore?
-The Hive metastore can be accessed using the Thrift interface. The Thrift interface provides a client-server architecture that allows applications to communicate with the Hive metastore service. The Thrift protocol enables clients to make remote procedure calls (RPCs) to retrieve metadata information and perform operations on Hive tables, databases, and partitions.

79-Is it possible to compress JSON in the Hive external table?
-Yes, it is possible to compress JSON data in a Hive external table. Hive supports various compression codecs, such as Gzip, Snappy, LZO, etc., which can be used to compress data stored in external tables. By specifying the appropriate compression codec in the table creation or alteration statement, JSON data can be efficiently compressed and stored in a compressed format.

80-What is the difference between local and remote metastores?
-In Hive, a local metastore refers to the metastore service running on the same machine as the Hive service or client. The metadata for Hive tables and partitions is stored locally on the same machine. On the other hand, a remote metastore refers to a metastore service running on a separate machine, and the metadata is stored on that remote machine.
Remote metastores allow multiple Hive instances to share the same metadata, enabling better coordination and consistency in multi-node or distributed Hive setups.

81-What is the purpose of archiving tables in Hive?
-The purpose of archiving tables in Hive is to store a copy of the table's data in a separate location for backup or historical purposes. Archiving can be done using Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) commands or external storage systems. Archiving helps protect data in case of accidental data loss or corruption and provides a means to restore the table's data if needed.

82-What is DBPROPERTY in Hive?
-DBPROPERTY is a function in Hive that allows you to retrieve the value of a specific property associated with a database. It takes the database name and property name as arguments and returns the corresponding value. This function is useful when you need to programmatically access and retrieve specific metadata or configuration information related to a database in Hive.

83-Differentiate between local mode and MapReduce mode in Hive.
-In local mode, Hive runs the query on the local machine where Hive is installed. It utilizes the local file system for storing intermediate results and does not involve the Hadoop MapReduce framework. Local mode is typically used for development and testing purposes.
In MapReduce mode, Hive leverages the Hadoop MapReduce framework to execute queries. It distributes the query processing across a cluster of machines, making it suitable for handling large-scale data processing tasks.
MapReduce mode is used in production environments where there is a need for distributed and parallel data processing capabilities.
